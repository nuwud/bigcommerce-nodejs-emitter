BigCommerce API V2 NodeJS Event Emitter Module
==============================================

Takes the hassle out of polling the BigCommerce API by monitoring specified resources and emitting events.

Note
----

This module is a tech demonstration built as a result of our in-house Buildathon event. At best it can be considered
alpha quality.

The eventual intention for this module is for it to be published to NPMJS for easy installation anywhere. The module
isn't ready for that just yet however.

That means this module is currently only intended for advanced NodeJS users who are comfortable with manually installing
and debugging a module.

Requirements
------------

NodeJS:

* nodejs 5.x - may work on others, but untested

Modules:

* wwwdude (npmjs.org)
* async (npmjs.org)
* dateformat (npmjs.org)

Usage
-----

See example.js for a usage example.
